        <summary>MTPK I/O: A true, Privacy Centric Project</summary>
        <p>
            To build a privacy centric website, we will focus around the Zero-Trust concept, and make it to where data
            can be encrypted by the user and server, but also unreadable by the server. Regardless of the user's preference 
            level, for security reasons, specific encryption details will not be disclosed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Default data storage: All data will be encrypted at-rest, excluding the user's username, and user-id.
            Data encrypted at-rest and only decrypted once the user is logged in.
            Passwords will be further encrypted regardless of whether the user chooses to further encrypt their data
            locally.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the user so chooses, the data can be locally encrypted by the user, then additionally encrypted by the
            server.
            This gurantees that the data can not be accessed by any admins, including the site creator, myself.
            This can be proven, where if you login to your user account, and your data is locally encrypted, data
            retrieved
            from the server will retain your encryption, and will be unreadable unless you import your local decryption
            key.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is a legal issue of the data stored, all site admins (including myself), will be unable to view
            locally
            encrypted data, however, we will be able to erase said data. If the user loses their local decryption key,
            they
            will be unable to retrieve their data, unless they store a master key on the server (however that may ruin
            the
            point of locally encrypting data.)
        </p>
    </details>

        <summary>Flexibility in Encryption</summary>
        <p>
            We plan on allowing users to chose their local encryption algorithms, as it will be consuming their own
            processing power;
            user's will have the freedom to chose between speed, or encryption complexity. Of course, we will recommend
            a default
            algorithm based on current day security standards. If possible, we will include a salt on top of the
            encryption for
            additional security.

        <summary>Your Data, Your Choice</summary>
        <p>
            You choose how we handle your data, and we lay down the pros and cons of your choice. Below is some levels of 
            how you want to handle your data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users will have a choice of how they want their data to be stored on this site:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level-0: Trusted</strong>. You trust this site, Data is stored, and encrypted purely by the server. 
                Data will be unencrypted when you logs in. If you forget your password, you can still recover your data. 
                You will be unable to customize encryption standards.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Level-1: Strict Trust</strong> You trust this site, but still want your data to be locally encrypted. 
                Data will be encrypted and decrypted locally. When the data reaches the database, it will change it's encryption. 
                This way, if you forget your password, you can still recover your data, and the data will return under your new 
                password's encryption, and you will be able to locally decrypt it using your new password.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Level-2: Zero-Trust</strong>. You will create a site password, and a local decryption password.
                The decryption password can be
                autogenerated or user created. You can choose whether to use your decryption key as a master key, and
                whether to
                store that key on the website. You can create sub-keys with your master key. If you forget your
                password,
                your data will be unrecoverable.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Level-3: Hybrid Zero-Trust</strong>. You will create a site password. Your site password can become a
                master key, or a master key can be auto generated.
                Your data will be encrypted locally, and at the server level. The experience will be seamless, and speed
                of decryption
                will be determined by your configured encryption standards, and your local computer's hardware
                capabilities. If you did not store your
                master key on the site, your data will be unrecoverable.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Passwords will be further encrypted regardless of whether the user chooses to further encrypt their data
                locally. The user's password will be encrypted by the site's system.
            </li>
